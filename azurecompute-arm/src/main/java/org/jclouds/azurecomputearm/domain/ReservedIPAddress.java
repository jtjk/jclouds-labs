/**
 * In most cases, you won’t need to specify a Reserved Private IP address (RPIP) for your virtual machine. VMs in a
 * virtual network will automatically receive a private IP address from a range that you specify. But in certain cases,
 * specifying a reserved private IP address for a particular VM makes sense. For example, a VM may provide DNS services,
 * or act as a domain controller, or any othr critical role that relies on known IP address assignment. Also, if you
 * have a VM that you plan to stop and deprovision at some point, but want retain the RPIP for the VM when you provision
 * it again. An RPIP stays with the VM even through a stop/deprovision state. You can specify an RPIP by using
 * PowerShell at the time you create the VM, or you can update an existing VM.
 *
 * If you have both VMs and PaaS instances in your virtual network, you may want to separate the VMs that have static
 * DIPs from your PaaS instances by creating a separate subnet for the VMs and deploying them to that subnet. It’s not
 * only helpful for you to be able to see your static VMs in a separate subnet and know immediately which have an RPIP,
 * but for this release, it also prevents a new PaaS instance from acquiring the RPIP from a VM that is in the process
 * of being stopped/deprovisioned (not just restarted). This is a current limitation in this release for mixed VM/PaaS
 * subnets and RPIPs. This issue doesn’t happen if you deploy only VMs to the subnet, even if some of the VMs don’t have
 * an RPIP. If you’ve already deployed your VMs, you can easily move them to a new subnet to avoid this potential issue.
